Vault initialized with 3 key shares and a key threshold of 2. Please securely
distribute the key shares printed above. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must supply at least 2 of these keys to unseal it
before it can start servicing requests.

Vault does not store the generated master key. Without at least 2 key to
reconstruct the master key, Vault will remain permanently sealed!

It is possible to generate new unseal keys, provided you have a quorum of
existing unseal keys shares. See "vault operator rekey" for more information.
